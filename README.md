# Game Description

This time our entry for the global game jam was all about Unity’s particle systems and trail renderer.
For the art-side we wanted to go for something shroomy, as it is Stefanie’s specialty.

We also chose to implement the Diversifier “Single Button Play”, as this simplicity in controls is a fun limitation.

Controls
Press ‘Space’ or tab on the screen to change the fly direction.

If you fly down, press once and you fly up.

Keyboard:

‘ESC’ = close the game
